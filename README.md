The purpose of this project is to refactor both the HTML and the associated
style sheet (CSS file).  The objectives are:

1) The webpage meets accessibility standards
2) Semantic HTML elements are used
3) The HTML and CSS files have a logical structure
4) All images have ALT attributes
5) Heading attributes fall in sequential order
6) The title is concise and descriptive
